    "The idea behind webscraping is this: gather data quickly and replicably from websites by taking advantage of the fact that web pages are structured documents. While they are individually idiosyncratic, they tend to be _internally consistent_. This means that web scraping is always a bespoke affair---you can't build a web scraper that will simply work in a generalizable way for all pages. However, there _are_ general principles that, when rehearsed, will allow you to develop a scraper for a given website without too much effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraper we're going to build today downloads key information about DUSP faculty from the [DUSP website's 'people' list](http://dusp.mit.edu/people). We're going to scrape information about affiliation, navigate through weblinks, and download photos. Along the way, we'll be doing some neat tricks---naming downloaded photos such that their nomenclature is consistent and dealing with missing and inaccessible information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll be using a couple of Python packages. The first is `bs4`, or Beautiful Soup 4. This is an HTML and XML parser which takes a downloaded web page and gives us objects and methods for navigating its structure inuititively. It's a very, very standard tool for use in web scraping applications. We'll also be using `wget` to download files, and `requests` to request webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the first thing you'll need to do is install these packages. Assuming you've created and activated your virtual environment, you'll want to install these packages using `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
